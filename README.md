# WIDA-NPM

Whenever I start a new project, I don't know what to write for the first commit. After doing a “git init” there is technically nothing there...

## Install

```npm
npm install -g wida-npm
```

# Usage

```bash
wida-npm
```
# Contributing

If someone wants to add or improve something, I invite you to collaborate directly in this repository: wida-npm
